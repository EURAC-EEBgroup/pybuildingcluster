ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models**
   Train Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models with automatic hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

üìä **Sensitivity Analysis**
   Conduct comprehensive one-at-a-time and scenario-based sensitivity analysis with interactive visualizations.

üéØ **Parameter Optimization**
   Use Optuna-based optimization to find optimal parameter combinations for energy efficiency.

üìÑ **Professional Reporting**
   Generate comprehensive HTML reports with insights, visualizations, and actionable recommendations.

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from pybuildingcluster import GeoClusteringAnalyzer
   
   # Initialize analyzer
   analyzer = GeoClusteringAnalyzer(
       data_path="building_energy_data.csv",
       feature_columns_clustering=['QHnd', 'degree_days'],
       target_column='QHnd'
   )
   
   # Run complete analysis
   results = analyzer.run_complete_analysis(
       clustering_method="silhouette",
       models_to_train=['random_forest', 'xgboost'],
       sensitivity_vars=[
           'average_opaque_surface_transmittance',
           'average_glazed_surface_transmittance'
       ]
   )
   
   # Get summary
   summary = analyzer.get_summary()
   print(summary)
